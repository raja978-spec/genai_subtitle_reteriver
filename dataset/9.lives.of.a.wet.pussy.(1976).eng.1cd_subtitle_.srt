1
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:36,691
Dear gypsy, I woke
up very early this morning.

2
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,735
David was still asleep and
the house was very quiet.

3
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,363
I dressed and went
to the stables.

4
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:48,627
As you know, I'm having an
affair with the new stableboy,

5
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,500
David brought back from France.

6
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:56,005
He's so young
and beautiful and quiet.

7
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:49,563
When he touches
me, I lose my mind.

8
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,892
I want to grab at him
and pull him to me,

9
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,521
to scratch at him.

10
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,323
Gypsy, I can't understand
anything when we're fucking

11
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:04,199
and god, when he
puts it into me,

12
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,124
and keeps pushing
deeper and deeper.

13
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,702
I feel I could come forever.

14
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,839
And the hay on my back and
him reaching inside me,

15
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,714
it's all I can bear not to
scream out and wake everyone.

16
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:33,449
And then when he comes,

17
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,874
when he comes, oh god,

18
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,786
how I love it when
he comes and comes.

19
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:48,051
Oh gypsy, you must really
learn to love men again.

20
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,131
Gypsy, you must really
learn to love men again.

21
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,097
Learn to love men again.

22
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,231
That's pauline.

23
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:03,103
She does nothing but have
intercourse all day long.

24
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,805
Then she writes me
letters about it

25
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,277
as if I might be interested.

26
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,858
Those are all hers,
faithfully written,

27
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:13,739
telling me about her
private afternoons

28
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,155
and her greasy paramours,

29
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:21,209
bragging about her incest,
her lechery and her violence,

30
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,752
but I know all that already.

31
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,382
You see, she's
really just a child.

32
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,919
I haven't seen her in a while,

33
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,756
but she keeps in close contact.

34
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,009
This is her way of
saying, I'm there by you.

35
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,982
And it's good, very good,

36
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:57,412
but I miss her and
sometimes I hate her

37
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,159
for not being here
when I need her.

38
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,419
What can I do?

39
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,668
All I have is the
letters and the opium

40
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,499
to explain why she's away.

41
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:25,725
Dearest pauline, have
you ever imagined

42
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:28,526
that your men have had
me as they've had you?

43
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,857
Have you guessed yet why
I know your lovers so well?

44
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:36,787
No.

45
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,997
You could never guess, my
simple, passionate pauline.

46
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,540
My present is your present.

47
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:48,831
But yours is not mine.

48
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,712
I share my moments with you,
I live my loves with you,

49
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,263
but not with your consent,
not with your knowledge.

50
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:07,895
But time will come

51
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:12,024
when you will know it
and you will want it.

52
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,739
But the time is not yet here.

53
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,178
Dear gypsy, it
began raining again today

54
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:01,675
as we left the house.

55
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:06,180
As usual, David and
I weren't talking,

56
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,887
but by now it doesn't
matter that much to me.

57
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:15,268
He wouldn't tell richio
or me where we were going

58
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,401
and so we all sat in silence,
staring out the windows.

59
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,699
Oh, we still make love together

60
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,372
when he's not snorting
coke with richio

61
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,122
or balling his mistresses
and boyfriends.

62
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,885
He's the only man I've ever
had who can fuck and fuck

63
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:50,016
and never lose his hard on
and I can come 100 times

64
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,597
and he keeps balling as
if nothing were happening,

65
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,017
but this cool detachment of his

66
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,478
which drives me so
wild when we're in bed,

67
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,357
makes the rest of my
life with him unbearable.

68
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,374
Which raised the humidity 93%.

69
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:12,711
The wind.

70
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,534
Fill it up please.

71
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:48,952
Do you have your key?

72
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,329
Oh.

73
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,271
Darling, I have to
go to the restroom.

74
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,742
Sir, you got a restroom here?

75
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:33,122
Yeah, I'll get you a key.

76
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,583
Here's the key.

77
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:57,972
Bathroom's in the back.

78
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,359
Thank you.

79
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,932
I'm laying out three
cards, Hungarian fashion,

80
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:13,013
representing pauline's past.

81
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:21,530
The empress, eternal symbol
of the female and fertility.

82
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:25,912
The emperor.

83
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,119
Symbol of paternity
and masculinity.

84
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:36,172
And the devil.

85
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,963
Symbol of the domination
of matter over spirit,

86
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,587
of revolution and incest.

87
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,598
But I knew this would read so.

88
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:50,267
I know pauline.

89
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:51,844
She has her grandmother's soul.

90
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:53,812
They even say she has her face.

91
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,940
You see, pauline's
great grandfather

92
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,237
and his two daughters came to
America in 1903 from Poland.

93
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:04,649
Pauline's great grandfather
was a very strict Christian.

94
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:09,995
He was really overprotective
with the two girls.

95
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,810
When the old man
would go out to work,

96
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,699
he would lock them
up in the apartment.

97
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,355
The only time they
could leave the house

98
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:17,244
was under his chaperone.

99
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,750
Life was pretty lonely.

100
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:24,631
And the older they got, the
more curious they became.

101
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,598
And he dwelt in a cave,

102
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,844
he and his two daughters.

103
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:43,154
And the first born said unto
the younger, our father is old.

104
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:50,320
There is not a man in the
earth to come in unto us

105
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:54,119
after the manner
of all the earth.

106
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,044
Come, let us give our
father wine to drink.

107
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:03,628
Let us lie with him and preserve
offspring for our father.

108
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,029
What are you looking at?

109
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:30,901
Nothing.

110
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:33,167
Why don't you help your
sister clear the table?

111
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:34,913
Don't just sit there.

112
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:46,083
Don't you think that's enough?

113
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:48,089
No, we have to get him drunk.

114
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,715
But sis.

115
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:51,593
What are you saying?

116
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:52,953
You whispering behind my back?

117
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:54,183
No, no.

118
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,600
Clean the table.

119
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:57,303
I told you to clean the table?

120
00:25:57,648 --> 00:25:58,928
Come and bring me
some more wine.

121
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,066
Coming.

122
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,409
Papa?

123
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:02,754
Papa?

124
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:05,918
He's sound asleep.

125
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,008
Yeah, come on.

126
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,584
Papa, papa.

127
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,005
He's asleep

128
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,261
After they got
the old man into bed,

129
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:01,093
the two girls knew by
instinct what they had to do.

130
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,438
Their father was so
drunk from all the wine

131
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:07,016
that he would never
wake up and so the girls

132
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,485
felt free to do with
him as they pleased.

133
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:33,897
It wasn't until paulines
grandmother had completely

134
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,269
satisfied herself

135
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,693
that the younger got her chance

136
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:58,186
Until sunup, the girls
continued to satisfy themselves

137
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,563
without regard for their father.

138
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,187
The old man never woke
and the whole night

139
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:05,523
remained a secret only
between the girls.

140
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:42,568
But the past appears
again in the future

141
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:45,316
and strange affairs seem
to run in the family.

142
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:50,784
Pauline has a lover,
a Nigerian Princess.

143
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,237
She came to this country
to celebrate her beauty.

144
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:58,955
She was black magic, darkness
of soul come to life,

145
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,286
a midnight flower.

146
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,002
Pauline befriended
her immediately.

147
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,675
She loved her purity
and her virginity,

148
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,255
but the evil forces had
other things planned,

149
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:15,267
violent things that made both
pauline and her lover suffer.

150
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:20,263
It was jealousy and
magic that brought it on,

151
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,271
but I had nothing to do with it.

152
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:31,196
Lovely mish, I was afraid
of that black bitch.

153
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,786
She knew pauline had
a spiritual tracker

154
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,414
and she would have stopped it,

155
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:40,586
but she didn't.

156
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:42,713
Now she doesn't want to.

157
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:43,791
She's forgotten it all.

158
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,713
In my own way, I love her
just as much as pauline does.

159
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,756
I tell her so while she
sleeps, only she can't hear it,

160
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:58,893
not with the bad dreams and all.

161
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,706
You want some more pear?

162
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:44,043
No thank you.

163
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:50,213
Do you know I still have
nightmares from that first time?

164
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,170
Not so much as in the beginning,

165
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,839
but it still
bothers me a little.

166
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:57,223
I know.

167
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,013
I could picture
myself all over again

168
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:06,559
I had only been here a few weeks

169
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,358
and it was late, very late.

170
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:13,952
You know what I'm saying, man?

171
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:19,067
Uh, young lady, uh,
young lady, got a minute?

172
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,445
Miss firefox, you got a minute?

173
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,701
Uh, young lady, miss firefox.

174
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,203
Damn girl, you should
be glad to speak to me.

175
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:33,256
Young lady, wait a minute.

176
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:34,878
Hold it, you got a minute?

177
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,506
Wait a minute, miss
firefox, ma'am,

178
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,256
you should be glad to
say something to me.

179
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,113
Get that fucking thing off her,

180
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,698
get that fucking thing off her.

181
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:49,958
Shit, get that fucking
thing off her, man,

182
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,580
get that fucking thing off her.

183
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:53,627
Get down, get down, man.

184
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:56,130
Get that goddamn dress off.

185
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,056
Oh shit!

186
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:29,705
Be cool...

187
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:31,749
Be cool...

188
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:33,827
Yeah

189
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,041
yeah

190
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:40,987
There used to be times

191
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,823
when I'd be so
jealous with pauline.

192
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,832
I wouldn't accept her
letters or answer her calls.

193
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,629
She couldn't understand that.

194
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:51,127
Whey should she?

195
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:53,418
She's never known a
jealous moment in her life.

196
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:57,680
You see, being her lover
today would never mean

197
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:00,178
you will be her lover tomorrow.

198
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,722
It's as if she
didn't have a memory.

199
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:05,475
Only the one in her arms
is the one she desires

200
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:09,650
and because of this,
our love was impossible.

201
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,730
I wanted to own her and
she couldn't be owned.

202
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:27,853
Gypsy, last night
I had a dream about you.

203
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,729
We were in bed, making love.

204
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:33,268
We'd been fucking for
what seemed like hours

205
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,568
and I was on the
verge of an orgasm.

206
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:38,730
I opened my eyes to look at you

207
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,408
and then the strangest
thing happened,

208
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:42,860
you became a man.

209
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:46,492
It wasn't like it used to be.

210
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,041
You weren't worried anymore
about who I'd been with

211
00:54:49,378 --> 00:54:52,745
the night before or where
I was going to go later on.

212
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:55,914
You didn't ask me
to stop seeing ocalo

213
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,716
or to give up the stableboy.

214
00:54:59,013 --> 00:55:02,426
You just took me and we
fucked without saying a word.

215
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:43,097
Then I came.

216
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,014
I asked you to stop
and you laughed.

217
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:50,852
We kept going on and on,
and we were so beautiful

218
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,976
with the moonlight on our back.

219
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,306
You were kneeling above me,

220
00:56:29,436 --> 00:56:31,222
driving your body into mine.

221
00:56:32,564 --> 00:56:34,771
You pressed so closely
I could feel the blood

222
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,807
rushing through your veins

223
00:56:37,152 --> 00:56:40,770
and I kept wishing over and
over that it would never stop,

224
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:43,735
that the first time
you knew what I wanted

225
00:56:44,118 --> 00:56:46,780
and you didn't let
anyone come between us.

226
00:56:47,121 --> 00:56:49,658
It was just me and you.

227
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:59,790
I gave myself to you and
you took me and kissed me

228
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:02,635
and kissed me

229
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:05,965
and kissed me

230
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,226
and kissed me

231
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:13,563
and kissed me

232
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:18,025
and kissed me.

233
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:56,603
Then you started to
bite and your teeth

234
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,180
kept sinking into me.

235
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:05,779
The pain was so beautiful,
I wanted you to keep biting,

236
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,116
to keep biting.

237
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:11,990
Oh gypsy, it felt so good,

238
00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:16,703
oh so good.

239
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,765
I tried to fight the desire.

240
01:05:40,654 --> 01:05:43,191
I tried to acknowledge
its sinister nature,

241
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,152
but without coercion, she
never would have returned.

242
01:05:49,037 --> 01:05:51,119
Now I must succumb to it.

243
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:52,787
She must succumb to it.

244
01:05:56,878 --> 01:05:58,539
There's no need
for these anymore.

245
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,441
Goodnight, sweet.

246
01:06:23,363 --> 01:06:24,853
The universe needs Patience.

247
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:28,280
False unity is no unity.

248
01:06:29,577 --> 01:06:33,115
There is no reality
except human reality.

249
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:53,636
Sister, I've been waiting.

250
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:56,722
It's been lonely and dark
for me here since you left.
