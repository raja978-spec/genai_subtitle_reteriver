2
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:12,216
Get your pig faces away from me!

3
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,965
Tired, my friend?

4
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,761
It's only water,
but you can have some.

5
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,269
I see you're not armed.

6
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,566
It's not healthy traveling
around these parts without a gun.

7
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,527
How are you doing for money?

8
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:25,164
Good. Pratt never refuses a deal
when it comes to helping a man in trouble.

9
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,672
I'll take your 20 dollars
and you take the empty pistol. Happy?

10
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,392
What did you say your name was?

11
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,523
Looks like you're the silent type.

12
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,528
Whatever your name is,
you've made a serious mistake.

13
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,243
Never turn your back on Pratt.

14
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,756
My name is Pecos.

15
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:37,736
MY NAME IS PECOS

16
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,504
Bury him.

17
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,963
Well, Smith?

18
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,548
Nothing.

19
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,426
It spluttered something this morning,
stopped and hasn't spoken since.

20
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,930
I've been waiting for news from San Antonio
since yesterday.

21
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:14,560
Dammit, Smith! The telegraph
is this town's only way to contact Laredo.

22
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,646
We have to move out of here
like everyone else.

23
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,649
I don't want to leave my daughter Mary
in this cesspool.

24
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,026
You've got to make
your damn machine work!

25
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,196
I'm doing what I can, Doctor.
Look, I'll try again.

26
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,257
- Good morning, Dr. Burton.
- There's nothing good about it, dear.

27
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,344
Don't be angry, Dr. Burton.
The rangers will come, you'll see.

28
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,765
Everyone in this town is on edge.
They can't wait to leave.

29
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,581
The barrel of rum!

30
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,669
You go inside.
We've got enough trouble already.

31
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,428
Don't kill him.

32
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,540
Go and get him.

33
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,818
You made us run, Brack.

34
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,404
Quick, go to the wagon.

35
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,701
Huh? Cat got your tongue
after all that running?

36
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,539
Don't tell us you thought
you'd keep all the money for yourself.

37
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,960
80,000 dollars just for you,
without sharing it with your friends.

38
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,213
That's not very nice, Brack.

39
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,559
It's empty, Brack.

40
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:53,523
When we cleaned out the bank in Laredo,
it was full.

41
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,196
We shouldn't have trusted
a damn bastard like you.

42
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,327
- Where were you planning on going?
- Go to hell!

43
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,542
Idiot.

44
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,670
What good's a dead man to us?

45
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,841
If the money's not in the bagâ¦

46
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,053
it must be somewhere else.

47
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,324
Search the wagon.

48
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,094
Nothing, Kline.
It's empty.

49
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,681
Damn them!
They played us for fools.

50
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,809
Must have hidden it
when we were waiting at the ford.

51
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,437
Bert, Alex.
Keep an eye on this hellhole.

52
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,440
We'll follow the wagon tracks.
Saddle up.

53
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,946
He's back.

54
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,075
- The dirty rat.
- Calm down, Papa.

55
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,828
It doesn't do any good.
You're just hurting yourself.

56
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:36,710
I'll only calm down when somebody
gives that murderer what he deserves.

57
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,811
We're quits, Alex.
Pay up.

58
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,315
It wasn't that easy in San Juan,
but I always pay my dues.

59
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,945
I've always hated the telegraph.

60
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,505
You sit over there.

61
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,259
Towns without a sheriff
are much more hospitable.

62
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,762
Houston's never had sheriffs.

63
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,473
The winters are too damp,
and the summers are too hot.

64
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,724
Exactly.

65
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,393
You're right, Alex.

66
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,896
You killed five in eight months.

67
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,606
That's pretty quick.

68
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,108
You didn't even make them suffer.

69
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,821
And Morton recited them all
his final sermon.

70
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,740
Morton?
Who's that?

71
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,370
There's Morton.

72
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,473
They're never still,
even when they're dead.

73
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,689
The sons of evil are lost because
your right hand crushes all enemies, O Lord.

74
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,816
Stop, Lucifer!
We're not finished yet.

75
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,445
I've never seen an ill omen like that.
Reminds me of a vulture.

76
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,114
Horrible.

77
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,367
Tedder's paying for this, right?

78
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,871
Of course, my friend. I'm all for the law,
and the law is the barrel of your pistol.

79
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,207
That's how we live just fine
without a sheriff.

80
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,044
- Where are you going?
- He's my brother Ned.

81
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,880
Been here a few days.
He's never owned a gun â

82
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,424
that's why I still have a brother.

83
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,884
The same merry mother!

84
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,224
That's Mr. Gordon from Laredo.

85
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,601
I don't want
to cause you any trouble, boys.

86
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,814
We're all calm in here.

87
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,691
Off you go, beauty.

88
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,276
Yes, I mean you.

89
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,319
Bring us something to eat.
Go on.

90
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,245
Do as I say,
and you might live to tell the tale.

91
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,584
If all goes well, we'll take a vacation
with Kline across the border.

92
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:29,132
And if anyone plays any tricks,
we'll set this place on fire with you inside it.

93
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,483
They drink too much here?

94
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,180
- Tequila.
- What?

95
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,976
Tequila.

96
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,894
I don't know ifâ¦

97
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,858
Look, you're Mexican,
and we don't have any drinks for Indians.

98
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,403
In fact, Indians can't even drink.
Right, Bert?

99
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,073
Why not try
drinking your donkey's piss?

100
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,868
Go on, try it.

101
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,870
I'm thirsty.

102
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,206
You hear that, Bert? He's thirsty.
What can we do?

103
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,209
I'll have a go at him.
You up for that?

104
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,880
No, it's too easy.
Mexicans don't count.

105
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,049
But this one's different.
He's armed.

106
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,886
You can all see the bastard's armed.

107
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,346
Maybe he robbed a dead man.

108
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,141
Seeing as you've got a gun,
Mexicanâ¦

109
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,687
let's see if you know how to use it.

110
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,991
No, I don't want whiskey.

111
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,494
I don't like it.

112
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,045
I said I want tequila.

113
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,310
Tequila.

114
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,356
Tequila, please.

115
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,543
Your days are numbered, stranger.

116
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,589
They were two of Joe Kline's men.

117
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,529
They need you in there.

118
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,907
No, my friend.
I don't touch Kline's men.

119
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,493
They're more dangerous
dead than alive.

120
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,546
We're wasting time.

121
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,798
It's no use searching.

122
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,012
There are only spiders
and red ants here.

123
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,388
Let's go back, Kline.

124
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,186
Sooner or later,
the rangers will be on our backs, too.

125
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,731
How can you find a bag
in a thousand square miles of desert?

126
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,985
That swine must have gone to Houston
in the wagon.

127
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,656
Why, when he could
cross the border?

128
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,454
Because he was working for someone.

129
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,039
That's why.

130
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,377
We're staying here
until we've found the money,

131
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,797
rangers or no rangers.

132
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,675
With Houston as our base.

133
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,554
And if one of us
has five aces in his hand,

134
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,059
he can consider himself dead.

135
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,073
What are you doing here?

136
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,701
You like cemeteries?

137
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:59,248
The Lord doesn't speak
only through Moses,

138
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,417
but through his pastors, too.

139
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:07,215
I'm ready to recite any kind of sermon,
even ones not in the Bible.

140
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,967
Don't you believe me?

141
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,643
You're mistaken not to trust Morton,
stranger.

142
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,771
Everyone comes looking for me
sooner or later.

143
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,843
A Mexican, you said?

144
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,262
Yes, a Mexican.

145
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,306
They'd already drawn their pistols,
but he was quicker.

146
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,601
I don't know how it happened, Kline,
believe me.

147
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:06,691
Strange. Those two could do
anything with a pistol â

148
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,068
anything except eat it â

149
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,862
and a lousy Mexican killed them?

150
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,617
This whole business stinks.

151
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:23,249
You know me, Tedder.
You know I keep my promises.

152
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,087
You can bet your whole filthy hovel
against a dollar

153
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,923
that I'll catch that Mexican.

154
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,927
And when I catch him
I'll rip out his soul.

155
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,805
If I find out that you've helped him,

156
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,725
you might as well blow your brains out
before I get back.

157
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,186
Black, Bud, Emerson.

158
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,356
You stay here. Go easy on the whiskey
and keep your eyes open.

159
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,443
Let's go and take a look around.

160
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,503
Girl!

161
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,681
They've found the bodies,
and they're looking for you.

162
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,809
You can't stay here.
Three of Kline's men are inside.

163
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,728
I don't want them to kill you.

164
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,065
We both want the same thing.
What's your name?

165
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,441
Esther.

166
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,485
Where are you from, Esther?

167
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:39,742
Boquilla, across the border. My people
work on the land between the mountains.

168
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,578
There's my father,
my sister Lola and my little cousin.

169
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,040
I've worked here for three years.
It's hard, but I eat.

170
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,542
Does the trapdoor by the cellar
still work?

171
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,424
Yes, but how do you know about it?

172
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,469
I know a lot about this village.

173
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,222
I've seen people
being born and dying.

174
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,849
And now?

175
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,310
More are going to die.

176
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,423
This is the best I can do for you.
Tortilla.

177
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,591
- Put it here.
- Bring me a plate, too.

178
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,600
Make sure it's all ready
when the others get here.

179
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,605
You didn't see anything outside,
bitch?

180
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,274
Watch out.

181
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,734
Why are you frightening the girl,
Black?

182
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,364
Slip into my bed, girl,
and you'll be safe.

183
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,870
Didn't they tell you?
All the girls who trust Bud are safe.

184
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,217
Go down to the cellar
and bring my wine, Tedder.

185
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,011
Go on, move!

186
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,566
Come here, Black.
Let's have some fun.

187
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,162
Look.
Don't you like the show?

188
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,126
- Leave her alone, you cowards!
- Wait.

189
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,380
Wash her first.
Mexican women are always dirty.

190
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,300
Let her go!
Cowards!

191
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,886
You were right.

192
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,055
We need to wash her first.

193
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,983
Hello, boys.

194
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,635
Where the hell
did this other Mexican pig come from?

195
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,390
Just imagine
if he's the rat Kline's looking for.

196
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:41,562
Right.
It may well be him, boys.

197
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,607
That sure is a miracle.

198
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:50,988
Kline's getting a sore backside
searching for this filthy bastard

199
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,407
and he just falls into our hands.

200
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,871
He's either very stupid
or very smart.

201
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,540
Spit out your name, Mexican.

202
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,961
There's no point.

203
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,172
Dead men can't hear,
and you're a dead man.

204
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,156
My nameâ¦

205
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,368
is Pecos.

206
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,083
There's some good wine
down there in the cellar.

207
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,753
A very precious wine.

208
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,182
Filthy bastard!

209
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,335
Those damn bastards will kill him.

210
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,838
Come away from there, Doctor.
Nobody can help him.

211
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,423
Ned's right, Papa.

212
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,092
When the rangers come,
we'll have justice, you'll see.

213
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,387
If I only I could handle a pistolâ¦

214
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,557
or use a stick of dynamite.

215
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,311
Calm down, Papa.
It has to end one day.

216
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,212
Ace of clubs.

217
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,632
Five dollars.

218
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,559
See?

219
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:14,191
Even your brother Tedder's in cahoots
with that murderer, you know.

220
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,401
But Tedder had no choice.

221
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,153
When Murchison died,

222
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,741
you know where Tedder got the money from
to take over the saloon.

223
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,994
From Kline's pockets, I know.
Right, Ned?

224
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,207
I was a doctor in Dodge City,

225
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,043
when they brought me
a man from Kline's gang.

226
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:37,339
He was bleeding all over
and full of lead.

227
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,426
I tried to get him back on his feet,

228
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,929
but he was pretty much dead
when they brought him in.

229
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,307
I did my duty as a doctorâ¦

230
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,435
but I didn't manage to save him.

231
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,231
But he was Kline's man,

232
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,484
and one day Kline came to town.

233
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,409
Here.
Look at my hands.

234
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:10,580
Kline broke my fingers one by one
with the butt of his pistol.

235
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,711
"And now you'll remember Kline,"
he told me,

236
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,507
"whenever you try
to cure somebody."

237
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,718
Papa.
Oh, Papa.

238
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,945
That's enough.

239
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,989
We've had enough fun.

240
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,661
And wastedâ¦

241
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,831
too much time.

242
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,001
You've lost some money, too, right?

243
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,715
What do you know
about that business?

244
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,384
Interfering busybody!

245
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,515
Where's the 80,000 dollars?

246
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,018
In a safe place.

247
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,271
What do you mean?

248
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,692
Go on, answer me.
Talk!

249
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,740
I was on the track
when the wagon arrived.

250
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:32,329
I saw a man throw a sack in the canyon
at Horn Peak.

251
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,581
You know the rest.

252
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,208
And who are you?

253
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,711
Just a Mexican.

254
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,215
I can see that.

255
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,763
There are too many Mexicans,
even in Mexico.

256
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,014
That's what I think.

257
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,978
Something wrong with your throat?

258
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,526
You've got two sharp eyes,
Mexican,

259
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,654
and I'll close them pretty quick.

260
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:13,036
Maybe he was telling the truth and that pig
Brack was working with this lowlife.

261
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,038
That could be it.

262
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,706
- Genko?
- Yes, Kline.

263
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,960
Lock him up
and don't let him out of your sight.

264
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,587
We're going to take a look
at the canyon.

265
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,090
We need to follow
the wagon tracks again.

266
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,695
There aren't any tracks, Kline.

267
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,947
If a wagon came by here,
I'll eat my boots.

268
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,782
Look carefully.

269
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,993
Nothing, Kline.
No footprints.

270
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,788
That Mexican lied to us.

271
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,917
Let's go back to Houston.
I'll make him spit out his soul.

272
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,349
He must have told you something.

273
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,936
You Indians
sniff each other out like dogs.

274
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,275
The other nightâ¦

275
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,405
I saw you talking to him
the other night.

276
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,575
I see everything at night.

277
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,288
"Look into the darkness,"
the Bible says,

278
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,667
"and your eyes will seek out the light."

279
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:19,597
But Morton knows some things
that aren't written, girl.

280
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:25,937
They say I'll do anything for money,

281
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,064
even good things.

282
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,899
Why make trouble for yourself?

283
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:52,672
That man
doesn't have much breath left.

284
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,183
Soâ¦ do you want
to tell me who he is, girl?

285
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,151
That way, at least he'll have his name
on his tombstone.

286
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,372
Anyway, when Kline gets backâ¦

287
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,458
he'll kill him.

288
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,699
Pecos!

289
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,412
Come with me.

290
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,289
I know a safe place.

291
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,823
Hurry, Papa!

292
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,117
On the sofa, Esther.

293
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,621
Come here, boy.

294
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,668
They've given you a nasty beating.

295
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,337
- Mary.
- Get some water.

296
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,796
Quick, Mary.

297
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,257
There.

298
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,262
You can't stay in the village.
I know Kline.

299
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,140
I know him, too.

300
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,895
A lot of blood but nothing serious.

301
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,314
So saddle up and get out of here

302
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:00,652
before Kline and his men
start searching all the houses.

303
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,780
- Esther can find you a horse tonight.
- No.

304
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,201
No. There's still something I have to do.
I'll leaveâ¦

305
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,661
Stay calm, now.

306
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:13,498
I'll leave your house
but not the town.

307
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,667
Esther, you need to go.

308
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,628
They'll be looking for you too now.

309
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,589
You need to leave right away.
Right away.

310
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,594
Neat work.

311
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,139
The knife's tied to a cord.

312
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,852
To a cord.

313
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,148
Somebody helped him.
We've been tricked.

314
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,484
Very revealing, Steve.

315
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,030
That man is more dangerous
than I'd thought.

316
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,157
We should have killed him
straightaway.

317
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,702
Yes, maybe you're right, Steve.

318
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,371
We should have killed him
without thinking twice.

319
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,039
But next timeâ¦

320
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,003
Hey, stop that.
You can get drunk later.

321
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,798
Go and wait outside.

322
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,718
Kline, look up.

323
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,304
- There's a hole in the floor here.
- The cord!

324
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:11,598
Where's it coming from, Jack?

325
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,891
The spinning wheel.

326
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,643
It was that bitch.

327
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,271
- She was pretending to spin.
- Filthy slut.

328
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,976
I'll give you one minute, Tedderâ¦

329
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,189
and then I'll kill your brother.

330
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,650
One more minuteâ¦

331
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,737
and I'll kill you, too.

332
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,908
Answer me.
Where's that bitch?

333
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,951
- I couldâ¦
- Where is she?

334
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:16,704
- I could be wrong, but Iâ¦
- Don't worry.

335
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,706
- I'd look for herâ¦
- No!

336
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,124
No, Tedder!

337
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,798
Tell me what you know.

338
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,968
I'd look for her at the old farm
on the road to the pass.

339
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:33,012
That's where her people live.

340
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:41,688
Let's split up.

341
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:44,065
You two go to the border.
You go with Slim.

342
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,733
I want that girl.

343
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,943
Where are you taking that?

344
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,320
I didn't know
you had branch offices in town.

345
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:33,156
It's for Dr. Burton.
I don't drink.

346
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,367
If I had a dollar
every time you were drunk,

347
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,828
I'd be richer
than the Archbishop of Canterbury.

348
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,831
Once in a while. If you don't drink,
what do you do with your mouth?

349
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,374
You're right.

350
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,169
I'll come with you.
I need to see the doctor, too.

351
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:50,047
And if you don't object,
I'll carry this to save you the trouble.

352
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,215
Alright.

353
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,272
Come on, Lucifer.

354
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,735
This is your home
whenever you need me.

355
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,155
I can't do much,
but I'm ready to help you.

356
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,866
Don't worry about me.

357
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,076
Thank you.

358
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,080
Thank you for your help.

359
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,133
Someone's coming.

360
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:48,147
What is it, Tedder?
And you too, Morton. What do you want?

361
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,650
The less I see of you, the better.
Stay away from here.

362
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,068
I'm here toâ¦

363
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,570
Don't get all het up, Doctor.

364
00:51:54,695 --> 00:52:00,701
All I've done
is help Tedder bring you some wine.

365
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:04,247
You shall tend the Lord's vineyards.

366
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,833
There's nothing against wine in the Bible.
Nothing.

367
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:12,547
And the wine in this barrel
is really very special.

368
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,133
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
Is that clear?

369
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:20,847
I don't mean to appeal
to your sense of solidarity, Burton,

370
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:26,811
but deep down there is something
a doctor and a pastor have in common.

371
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,730
What are you talking about,
you damn vulture?

372
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,441
What wine are you talking about?
What's this all about?

373
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:35,611
I don't want anything from you.
Get out of here.

374
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,990
It's from my brother Ned, Doctor.

375
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:45,121
They brought me some good wine
from Boquilla. Excellent wine.

376
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,289
And?

377
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:50,293
My brother Ned said we need to offer some
to the doctor, and I said why not?

378
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:51,502
Yes.

379
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,548
As the proverb says,
drink first and then spit it out.

380
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,883
It's so right.

381
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,386
Well, if it's a gift
from your brother, that's fine.

382
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,762
Thank him from me.

383
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,939
Where are those bandits?

384
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,109
Kline and his men aren't in town.

385
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,486
They've gone to find
that Mexican and the girl.

386
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,780
It's going to be hard to find them.

387
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:22,575
The desert's big
and Mexico's nearby.

388
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,914
I think some have gone looking for them
at Esther's family home.

389
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,749
They'll be back soon.

390
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,294
Don't worry, I'll carry it inside.

391
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,557
I'm not convinced by this business.

392
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,977
Not at all.

393
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,147
I'm not convinced.

394
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:56,025
If someone came to my house
with a barrel of wine,

395
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,194
my door would be wide open,

396
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,154
but they slammed it in your face.

397
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,824
Aren't people strange?

398
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:06,285
Or maybe not.

399
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,703
Burton.

400
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,336
Do you value your life
and your daughter's?

401
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,129
What do you mean?

402
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,673
Just what I said.

403
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:21,884
If you value your life,
get rid of this.

404
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,682
This wine is dangerous.

405
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:33,229
I don't understand. Tedder's a rogue
and would sell his soul for a dollar,

406
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,523
but he wouldn't go as far
as poisoning wine.

407
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,651
Some things
are more deadly than poison.

408
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:43,280
Kline's not leaving the village because
he's looking for something that's in here.

409
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:48,411
If that's the case,
tell us what we need to do.

410
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,081
- We need to get rid of Kline.
- Alright, Pecos.

411
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:57,920
You have a man who can't use his hands
and two girls at your command.

412
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,465
That's not very encouraging,
but we'll do our best.

413
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,343
- What do you need?
- Do you have any other weapons here?

414
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,972
An old pistol
and a few sticks of dynamite.

415
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,724
That'll do.

416
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,977
I'll write the recipe.

417
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,361
Find anything?

418
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,114
Not a trace, Kline.
He didn't cross the ford.

419
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,534
Let's hope Jack's found the girl.
You two go back to Houston.

420
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,245
- Which way?
- The north road.

421
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,330
Alright.
Are you following us?

422
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:36,417
We'll take the south road.
I don't want any surprises.

423
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,127
Alright, Kline.

424
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,318
- You didn't see anyone go by?
- No, <i>seÃ±or.</i>

425
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,153
Think hard.

426
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,156
Tell us the truth
and don't waste my time.

427
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:10,659
I asked you where your daughter is.

428
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:14,371
And if you've seen an armed Mexican
on horseback sniffing around.

429
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,375
He came by a few hours ago.
There's no way you didn't see him.

430
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,544
- I said no, <i>seÃ±or.</i>
- And your daughter?

431
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:23,714
Esther comes here very rarely.
She works for Mr. Tedder.

432
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,133
- Who's she?
- My name's Lola, <i>seÃ±or.</i>

433
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,676
Esther's my sister.

434
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,721
Seeing as we're here,
let's have some fun.

435
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:36,102
Little Lola's not bad.

436
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,166
Slim, you're not her type.

437
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,419
She doesn't like you.

438
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,171
Watch out for the horse.

439
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,593
Go on, Slim!

440
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,939
Slim!
Go for it!

441
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,335
Slim!
Go on!

442
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,166
- What do you want at this hour?
- I need to talk to you, Frank.

443
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,043
All I have is eight dollars.

444
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:09,004
It's not much to hire a good horse,
I know,

445
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,548
but I've got to get to Laredo
before nightfall.

446
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,883
Does Tedder know?

447
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:16,178
No, but my brother's happy
when I'm out of his way, Frank.

448
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,765
- Why haven't you told Tedder?
- Look, I need that horse.

449
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,851
I don't like this.
What are you going to Laredo for?

450
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:27,648
There are better girls in San Juan
or Boquilla, across the border,

451
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:32,278
and the Mexican girls will do more for you
than any girl in Laredo.

452
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,071
They give you credit, too!

453
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,199
Give me the horse, Frank.
I want to warn the rangers.

454
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,703
Is your brother in the saloon?

455
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,205
Then listen to me.

456
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,292
I've become very thirsty,
and I want to have a beer.

457
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,086
So I'm going for a drink.

458
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,796
Here's a horse.

459
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:55,384
If a boy who's slightly out of his head
takes the horse and rides off,

460
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,011
how would I know?

461
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,138
I'm just very thirsty.

462
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,598
Good luck.

463
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,388
Get on your feet.

464
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,475
Where were you off to?

465
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,774
Why don't you answer me, runt?

466
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,232
Pecos!

467
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,528
Pecos!

468
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,196
Pecos!

469
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,407
Don't shout, I can hear you.

470
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,451
Kline's menâ¦
The bastardsâ¦

471
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:49,206
Kline's men killed my brother.
He was only a boy.

472
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,708
I thought you only cared
about money.

473
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,213
Once, Pecos, but not anymore.

474
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,341
When I saw him lying there,
murdered like a dogâ¦

475
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,302
He wanted to run
and warn the rangers.

476
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,473
It's your fault that he's dead.
I can't do anything about it.

477
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:07,599
Get out of here.

478
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,935
But he did it for Esther.

479
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,146
- For the whole town.
- Really?

480
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,522
And what do you want from me?

481
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,649
Help me get my revenge.

482
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,067
And I'll help you.

483
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:19,319
Come on, tell me the truth.
Spit it out.

484
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:21,238
You're talking about the barrel?

485
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,825
There's 80,000 dollars inside it.

486
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,412
Brack and I made a deal.
We'd hide it.

487
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,457
Think what you like, Pecos,

488
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:34,126
but 80,000 dollars
is a lot of money.

489
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,963
We should have split it,

490
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:43,385
but Joe Kline killed Brack,
so I put it somewhere safe.

491
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:48,307
I know. In the doctor's house.
Nobody will think of looking there, right?

492
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,726
Right.

493
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:54,855
But I want Kline to pay
for my brother's death.

494
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,149
- And Iâ¦
- You must kill him.

495
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,984
Only you can do it.

496
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,154
I'll give you Brack's share afterwards.

497
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:05,532
But watch out for Morton.

498
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,451
He's sold you out once already.

499
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:11,955
Alright, Tedder. Maybe I will help you.
Now get out of here.

500
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,438
The nine of hearts
and the three of clubs.

501
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,609
Not bad, Kline.
Not bad.

502
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:45,489
Money. I see a lot of money,
and within reach.

503
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:48,033
Stop being an idiot
and talk straight.

504
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,161
Queen of hearts.

505
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:57,292
An idiot? I can read the cards,
and the cards predict the future.

506
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,336
You know what I want to hear.

507
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,005
Rat!

508
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,888
What you're looking for could beâ¦

509
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,099
Here's the two of clubs!

510
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,850
â¦ hidden in a trunk.

511
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:16,395
No, maybe in a barrel.

512
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,605
Go on.

513
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,856
Well, actuallyâ¦

514
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,114
Isn't that enough?

515
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:32,160
Or shall I shoot you in the mouth
and take the money back?

516
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,663
Didn't you think of that,
smart-ass?

517
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,956
Listen to me, Kline.

518
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,084
Shoot him right now.
Shoot him in the mouth.

519
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,170
He stinks.
I've always found him disgusting.

520
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,968
I'm useful to you, Kline.

521
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:50,512
Why kill me?

522
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:53,849
Here.

523
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,517
Carry on.

524
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,105
Jack of hearts.

525
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,565
Here's the ace of diamonds.

526
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,567
Well?

527
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:07,321
Well, I'd shake Tedder up a little.

528
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:10,282
- Tedder?
- Yes, to make him ringâ¦

529
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,535
like Lucifer's bell.

530
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,331
Talk straight.

531
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,627
For another coinâ¦

532
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,797
I can tell you
the name of the Mexican

533
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,925
who's having fun killing your boys.

534
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:39,353
I'll pay double. Talk, you lowlife,
and tell me how it's all going to end.

535
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,485
Ace of spades.

536
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,029
Queen of spades.

537
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,577
Pecos Martinez is going to kill you.

538
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,580
The last of those bastards.

539
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,166
Remember.

540
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,797
The cards never lie.

541
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:15,555
It'll be even easier
when we're face to face.

542
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,586
Not a bad bank.

543
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,798
The dead don't steal.

544
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:53,927
Damn!

545
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,807
You scared me.

546
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,475
I don't want to scare you.

547
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,145
I want to kill you.

548
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,571
You're joking, right?

549
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,698
I never joke.

550
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,616
No.

551
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:19,870
No, you're not the type
who would kill an unarmed man.

552
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:22,038
But you're not a man.

553
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,874
- You're a worm.
- No, Pecos!

554
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:26,334
Listen.
I'll do whatever you ask.

555
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,128
I'll do anything for you.

556
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:29,588
I don't want to die.

557
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,757
In the name of the Bible,
don't kill me.

558
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:34,259
Did you see?
I've got a lot of money. A lot.

559
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,763
Nearly 3,000 dollars.
It's yours. Take it!

560
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,099
You and your money disgust me.

561
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,520
I'll give you one day.
Now get out of here.

562
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:49,566
Nobody must ever see you again in Houston
or smell your stench.

563
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,821
I won't ask
if you sold me out to Kline

564
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:58,241
because you'd swear on the Bible
and lie like you always do.

565
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:01,787
Get out of here.

566
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,275
- Don't move!
- What do you want?

567
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,943
You know very well, you old fool,

568
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,321
and this time you won't get away
with a few broken bones.

569
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,073
Your daughter, I imagine.

570
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,950
Not bad.

571
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,828
But I don't think she's yours,
you old goat.

572
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,248
Nothing in here.

573
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,333
Or in here.
No barrel, no money.

574
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,587
Get out.
All of you, get out of my house.

575
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:36,298
I don't know what you're looking for,
and I don't want to know.

576
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,383
Go to hell!

577
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,977
Don't worry, he's got a thick skin.

578
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:56,943
I want to know two things.

579
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,279
And you're going to tell me.

580
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:04,326
Then you can go and take care
of your father without any more trouble.

581
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,913
Where's the barrel
that Tedder handed over to your father?

582
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:10,999
And where's the Mexican hiding?

583
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:14,502
As you can see,
the questions aren't that difficult.

584
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,588
Tedder came and took it back.

585
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,091
You're lying.

586
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,511
Tell us everything you know.
It's for your own good.

587
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,558
If we're going to get along,

588
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,518
you need to tell the truth, girl.

589
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,731
I can make you talk, sweetheart.

590
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,067
I'm sure we'll have some fun.

591
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:39,736
Tell Kline.

592
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,781
Steve likes seeing people suffer.

593
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,992
Especially women.

594
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,996
But you don't need to worry
if you talk right away.

595
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,506
Not bad at all, that chick.

596
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,803
Do you boys want to deal with her?

597
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:09,808
I'll let you have her later.
She's all yours for now, Steve.

598
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,476
Alright, Kline.

599
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,109
I've got a good idea.

600
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,902
You're wearing too many clothes.

601
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,906
I'll take them off,
and you can walk around the house naked.

602
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,616
Very good, Steve.

603
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,284
I like her.

604
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,790
You'll serve us and cook for usâ¦

605
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,628
wearing nothing
but a ribbon in your hair.

606
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,339
What do you say, boys?

607
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,008
Isn't that a great idea?

608
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,803
We needed a woman
to take care of us

609
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:50,098
and Burton's daughter
will do very nicely.

610
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,983
Papa! No!

611
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,531
He wanted to take my gun.

612
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,993
Go on, talk.
You can cry later.

613
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:13,496
I'm asking you for the last time.

614
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,375
Where's the money?
And where's that Mexican hiding?

615
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,377
Morton told me everything.

616
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,795
I know who he is.

617
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:06,002
That's enough. Let her breathe a little.
If you kill her she won't talk.

618
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,880
If you don't talk,
you know what we'll do to you.

619
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,299
Tell me where the money is.

620
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,134
And where the Mexican is.

621
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,097
Then your troubles will be over,
I promise you.

622
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:20,266
Noâ¦ no!

623
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:24,145
I don't know where Pecos is,
but I know he'll get even with you.

624
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,688
Murderers!

625
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,191
Start again.

626
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,781
Someone's here.

627
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,958
The bastard's coming.

628
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,670
- Let's give him the welcome he deserves.
- What shall we do with the girl?

629
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,171
Forget her, you fool.

630
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,465
It'll be easier
once we've dealt with the Mexican.

631
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,592
Are you afraid, Kline?

632
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,096
No.

633
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,556
But that man must die.

634
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:03,351
First he'll tell us
where he hid the money,

635
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,854
then he'll die a slow death.

636
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,732
He must be an old friend of yours
if you treat him that well.

637
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,126
It's an old story that's been going on
for three years.

638
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,545
He's been following me
like a ghost.

639
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,381
We need to send him back to hell.

640
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,342
Bud, distract him.

641
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,094
We'll cover him, boys.

642
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:56,654
He got hit.
Cover me. I'll try.

643
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,722
Push the girl out.

644
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,515
We'll use her as a shield.

645
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,393
Ladies first.

646
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,878
Hey, Pecos!

647
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,005
Do you hear me?

648
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,552
I hear you, Kline.
What do you want?

649
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,430
I want the money,
and I want it right now.

650
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,683
Then we'll get on our horses
and leave.

651
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,229
Hurry up or we'll kill the girl.

652
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,648
I'll give you one minute
to think it over.

653
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,734
I've already thought it over, Kline.

654
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:45,805
Watch out, boys.

655
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,141
He's preparing
some kind of nasty trick.

656
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:49,642
Keep your eyes wide open.

657
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,520
As soon as we've got the money,
I'll fill him with lead.

658
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:24,487
Quick, bring me that barrel.

659
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:34,288
It's all in there.
Count it.

660
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:49,220
80,000 dollars that Brack stole from you
and Tedder hid.

661
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,889
Take it, Kline, and get out of here.

662
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,437
It's there, Kline.

663
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:01,107
Kline,
how are you going to spend it?

664
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,904
You can't get rid of that red line
that marks your place in hell.

665
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:11,242
Money's no good to you.
Your fate is settled.

666
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,161
You're finished.
You won't leave Houston alive.

667
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,790
You've played all your cards
and you've lost.

668
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:26,132
Open your ears, Kline.

669
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,178
The rope left a deep furrow
on your neck,

670
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:34,140
and I'll finish the hangman's work
with my own hands.

671
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:36,934
Look, Pecos.

672
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:41,397
They did hang me, it's true,
but they couldn't finish the dance.

673
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,983
I'll play the music this time.

674
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,568
The rope for me?

675
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:51,741
For Joe Kline, just for destroying
a lousy family by the name of Martinez?

676
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,410
That was your family, Pecos.

677
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,871
Today, I'll settle my account,
and you'll pay.

678
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:02,627
- Let me go!
- No, Esther.

679
01:22:10,718 --> 01:22:13,220
It's my duty to kill you, Klineâ¦

680
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,141
by order of the court of Houston.

681
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,166
What will we do with the money?

682
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:09,003
Build yourselves a bigger cemetery.

682
01:24:10,305 --> 01:25:10,480
