2
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,708
Straight into the
lounge, get the door.

3
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,667
Adam Roberts.

4
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,417
This has gone far enough.

5
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,625
We've still got time.

6
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,000
We can call the police.

7
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,500
And say what exactly?

8
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,042
Hello, we killed someone,
brought them back to my house

9
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,750
and now decided it was maybe
a good time to let you know.

10
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,625
We can say he was alive.

11
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,208
We brought him into keep him
warm so we could use the phone,

12
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:02,292
and then he died
while we were waiting.

13
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't play dumb, Simon.

14
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,625
You know as well as I do the
second the police arrive,

15
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,958
no matter what
the circumstances,

16
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,500
tomorrow morning, polling day,

17
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:19,375
yes, our faces are on the
front page of every newspaper

18
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,917
in the country
accompanied by very, very,

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,250
very bad headlines.

20
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:33,333
Come on, forget what that means
for our careers, our lives,

21
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,708
your family's lives.

22
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,042
What about the party?

23
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,750
All the other candidates
facing election tomorrow.

24
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,625
All the people that
need our party.

25
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:50,208
We can't let one accident
jeopardize everything.

26
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,083
You think I don't know that?

27
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,073
You think I don't realize that.

28
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,042
There's a phone right there.

29
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,625
If you genuinely, and I
mean, genuinely believe

30
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,458
the best thing to do
is call the police

31
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,042
and tell them what
happened, then do it.

32
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,042
Hello, Bertie Oldcross.

33
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,375
Yes, Ms. Robinson,
I do apologize.

34
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,458
Simon had a slight
red wine accident

35
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,042
and needed a fresh shirt.

36
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,042
The party, they're
wondering where we are.

37
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,750
Nowhere.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,417
Make something up.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,625
We cannot go to that party.

40
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,875
I know, Mrs. Robinson,

41
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,375
I'm looking forward to
celebrating with you too.

42
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,250
What would it look
like if we don't?

43
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,000
We go for an hour, keep
everything settled,

44
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,792
and then sort this
when we get back.

45
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,000
No Bertie, no.

46
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:13,083
Here he is now, Mrs.
Robinson, all sorted.

47
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,500
We will be with you in 10.

48
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,792
This is all gonna
end badly, Bertie.

49
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,042
We've got to go.

50
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,333
40 minutes, then we'll
say we need an early night

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and slip off.

52
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,875
Give him a moment.

53
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Shall we?

54
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,250
Oh.

55
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,292
Please, you're very kind,

56
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,268
but there's no need to
pretend you're here for me.

57
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,708
I know you've really
come for the free booze.

58
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,500
Speaking of which, who was
gonna show me to the bar?

59
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,167
Ah.

60
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:36,958
Mr. Adeveret?

61
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,333
Oh, Mrs. Robinson.

62
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,792
Did I startle you there.

63
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,208
Just a bit, yeah.

64
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,917
Sorry, I am sorry.

65
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,792
Good final numbers
we had, right.

66
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,125
Fantastic, yeah, thank
you for all your help

67
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,375
during the campaign.

68
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, help's been superb.

69
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, anything for
Bertie and the party.

70
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,917
You know that, Mr. Adeveret.

71
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,458
And how's the family, all okay?

72
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,667
All good, thank you.

73
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,625
They must be so very proud
of what you're trying to do.

74
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,500
You think Bertie will
say a few words tonight?

75
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,143
Oh, I shouldn't think
so, Mrs. Robinson,

76
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,833
it's been a very long campaign.

77
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,333
Oh, sorry, Mr.
Adeveret, I almost forgot.

78
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,500
Someone actually rang here
just before you arrived.

79
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,458
They said they tried your house,

80
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,684
but you'd already left the
party.

81
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,250
That's the number, they
said you should give them

82
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,208
a call back as soon
as you had a moment.

83
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,125
Who is this?

84
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,208
Oh, yes, it's the head of this.

85
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,458
Right, well, I better
get on and do this then.

86
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,458
Labour head
office, Jonathan speaking.

87
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,792
Oh, hello, Jonathan,
it's Simon here,

88
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,625
Bertie Oldcross
campaign manager,

89
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,000
Scarborough and Whitby.

90
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,375
Ah, glad we've tracked you down.

91
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,125
You're at the Whitby
Social Center?

92
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,292
Yeah, at the end of campaign
party, with the volunteers.

93
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,667
Okay, and Bertie's there?

94
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,750
He is, yep.

95
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,917
Right, I'm
letting you know, Simon,

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,125
we got wind of the unfortunate
incident earlier this evening

97
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,125
and for the good of the
party, we have alerted police.

98
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,250
They'll be there soon.

99
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,833
Obviously we'll spin the
story as best we can,

100
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,476
but it's not going to
be the best of times

101
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
for you and Bertie.

102
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,792
You understand that
it's crucial we protect

103
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,275
the party from
incidents like this,

104
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,583
especially the day
before general election.

105
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,417
Hello, Laura speaking,
Labour Party, head office.

106
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:05,333
Hello, it's Simon, Bertie
Oldcross's campaign manager,

107
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,542
Scarborough and Whitby

108
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
Ah, fantastic,
thanks for calling back.

109
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,823
Looks like it's going to be
a great day for you tomorrow.

110
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,292
Very promising numbers.

111
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,125
Yes, yes, we're
all very excited.

112
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,625
We've had great
numbers across the country

113
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,833
in our final polls.

114
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,333
So if that's reflected in
the result tomorrow night,

115
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,250
it'll be a special
moment for everyone.

116
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,667
Fantastic.

117
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,833
Yeah, that's fantastic.

118
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,500
So the leadership has started

119
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,792
to identify potential options
for government positions.

120
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,625
Just getting a sense of
what our administration

121
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,083
could look like if
things do go away.

122
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,458
Right.

123
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,792
And based on Bertie's stance

124
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,375
on crime and justice
throughout the campaign,

125
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,042
something that's really
caught the public's attention,

126
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,000
we believe he would be
an ideal option to fill

127
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,458
the minister of state
for prisons position.

128
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,292
Prisons, the
minister for prisons?

129
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
Now, obviously
this is all preliminary

130
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,000
and dependent on the
final results tomorrow,

131
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,042
but it's something worth
discussing with Bertie,

132
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:03,857
as things will start
to move quickly

133
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,417
as the picture becomes
more clear after voting.

134
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,875
Minister of state for prisons.

135
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,292
Yes, so I'll
leave that with you.

136
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,792
Yes.

137
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,792
Yes, thanks for letting me know.

138
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,750
And finally I have to ask,

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,726
is there anything you
need to let us know about

140
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,625
going into tomorrow, anything
we need to be aware of?

141
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,083
No, nothing I can think of.

142
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,083
Okay, I'll let you
get back to your party then.

143
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,458
Best of luck tomorrow.

144
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,750
Thank you so much.

145
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,542
Everyone, everyone...

146
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,292
I'd just like to say
thanks to you all and what

147
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,583
an absolute pleasure it's
been getting to know you all

148
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,958
throughout the campaign
over the last few weeks.

149
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,500
And I'm sure all our hard
work will be worth it

150
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,500
when Bertie Oldcross
is elected tomorrow

151
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,333
to represent
Scarborough and Whitby.

152
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:19,833
Now, I'm sure the man himself
has a few words of his own.

153
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:27,208
Now I won't say much, I promise,

154
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,333
but now I'm sure you've all
had enough of my voice by now.

155
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:38,000
Obviously I want to thank
you all for your support

156
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,667
and the time you have
given to my campaign.

157
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,500
Trust me, we couldn't
have done it without you.

158
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:49,792
And I just want to
say that if the result

159
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,958
goes my way tomorrow,

160
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,250
I will spend every day

161
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,375
making sure our country

162
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,417
is a happier, more prosperous,

163
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,792
safer place to live.

164
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,583
Now it's been a long campaign.

165
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,292
Simon and I have a
very big day tomorrow,

166
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,042
so we're going to
call it a night.

167
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,958
But by all means you stay
and enjoy yourselves.

168
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,125
You've earned it.

169
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,792
Thank you so much.

170
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,292
Thank you, thank you so much.

171
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,583
See you next time.

172
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,583
Simon, Simon.

173
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,583
How'd you do that?

174
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,500
Do what?

175
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,417
Put on that show.

176
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,583
You would tell those lies.

177
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,125
What do you mean,
they weren't lies.

178
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,042
There was a man lying
dead on your sofa.

179
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,042
What is wrong with you?

180
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,250
Would you pull
yourself together?

181
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,208
We could go a prison, Bertie.

182
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,833
Yeah, if I don't act
as I normally would,

183
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,997
then you are right, that is
exactly what will happen.

184
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,458
You know, yours
is the first door

185
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,333
they will knock
on if I'm caught.

186
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,000
We're in this together, Simon.

187
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,708
Just get in.

188
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,083
Thoughts?

189
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:37,458
I've got saws in the garage.

190
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,833
For what exactly?

191
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,958
You know.

192
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,792
That's disgusting.

193
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,917
No, we just need to
move the thing as is.

194
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,583
We could throw it in the sea.

195
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,708
No, it'll be washed up
on the beach by morning.

196
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,917
We didn't get noticed
throwing it in the water.

197
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,208
No, I need to find
somewhere to bury it

198
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:13,708
so it'll stay there, somewhere
just to get us past tomorrow.

199
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,333
After the elections, we're
slightly in the clear.

200
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,917
Right.

201
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,708
We're gonna need some shovels.

202
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,125
Right.

203
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,750
Hello, Sarah, sweetie, it's
just me leaving you a message

204
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,000
just to say I'm
back at Bertie's.

205
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,625
A few more points we need
to cover for tomorrow,

206
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,042
so I'll be a few more hours.

207
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,250
So don't wait up.

208
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,125
Okay, bye.

209
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,167
I love you.

210
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,083
This was your perfect spot?

211
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,792
It's plenty of land.

212
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,625
It's nice and secluded
and it's all we've got.

213
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,625
Shall we?

214
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
Enough?

215
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,208
I really do hope so.

216
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,393
Just hurry up and drag
him there so we can leave

217
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,333
all this behind.

218
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,500
Just calm down.

219
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,000
Tomorrow, everything
will be back to normal.

220
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,375
Normal?

221
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,417
We are stuck in a damn wood
in the middle of the night.

222
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,917
Tomorrow or any other
day for that matter

223
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
will not be normal.

224
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,750
Will you keep your voice down?

225
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,542
That was the point of
doing all this, no?

226
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,417
Restoring normality

227
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,958
to make sure

228
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,333
we can get on

229
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,833
with doing what
we set out to do.

230
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:49,750
I am doing this with
the good of the people,

231
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,750
to make this country a
better place for them.

232
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,375
That is what I care about.

233
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,292
Trust me, it's very
clear what you care about.

234
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:06,000
I just hope after this,
I can trust you Simon.

235
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,934
I've got more at stake than you.

236
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,625
Oh, well golly for you.

237
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,792
I don't have to listen to this.

238
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:40,875
Listen, Simon, I'm sorry
for snapping like that...

239
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,542
Hey Bertie Oldcross,
man of the people.

240
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,375
I never forget a face.

241
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:05,167
Well, well, we are in some
trouble, aren't we Bertie?

242
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,083
You socialist scum.

243
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,125
Just can't help
yourselves, can you?

244
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,208
Let me explain

245
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,417
I'll do the talking, Oldcross.

246
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,542
Me and you were gonna take a
little walk up to the house

247
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,208
and we'll see what the
police make of all this.

248
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:37,458
The saddest thing of all
is you genuinely thought

249
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,208
you'd get away with
this, didn't you?

250
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,042
This is all your fault.

251
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,708
Just look at this mess.

252
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,125
You made me do this.

253
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,208
That is definitely not
the answer, Simon, come on.

254
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,167
Who cares?

255
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,333
Who cares what the
answer is to any of this?

256
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,042
He fired twice.

257
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,667
There's no shots
left in the thing.

258
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,875
Just look at this mess.

259
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,292
It's all gone wrong.

260
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,458
Just what have we done?

261
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,292
Two guys die tonight
because of us,

262
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
because of the choices we made.

263
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:54,375
We can't do anything
to change that now.

264
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,875
But if we achieve,

265
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,458
if we genuinely deliver,

266
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:14,083
surely that makes up
for our actions tonight.

267
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:16,792
Surely.

268
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,667
Just get the shovel.

269
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,708
I know it doesn't
seem like it now but,

270
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:07,375
I'm certain we made
the right choices tonight.

271
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,625
I don't know we had much
choice in any of this, Bertie.

272
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,583
You know, they actually offered
you minister for prisons.

273
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,375
Yeah.

274
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:24,375
Party head office rang,
jobs basically on the table.

275
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,083
That's what I
mean though, Simon.

276
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,917
This is a real opportunity.

277
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,583
You know what I'm
thinking Bertie.

278
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,083
I'm thinking what's
best for my family.

279
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:42,750
You know what my answer is?

280
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,583
Get the election outta the way,

281
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,958
get the all clear on that front

282
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,958
and we'll
reduce the impact a bit.

283
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:55,792
Then I'm gonna go to the police
and tell them everything.

284
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,667
Reckon I can get around killing
the farmer on self defense.

285
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,625
He had a gun, I had
a shovel, right?

286
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,583
I'm looking at perverting
the course of justice.

287
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:13,458
Probably get away with no
prison time, coming clean,

288
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,042
handing them you.

289
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,417
That's what I'm
thinking, Bertie.

290
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,292
That is what I am thinking.

291
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,958
You know, here's
what I'm thinking.

292
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,167
I'm sure I can handle
myself for one day.

293
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,375
So you do your thinking
and choose very carefully

294
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,667
what your future is going to be.

295
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,042
If you want to build
something great together,

296
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,667
I'll see you
tonight at the gala.

297
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,917
If you choose not to come,

298
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,750
then our guess I'll know
you've chosen your plan,

299
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,333
and I'll expect to
get a knock at my door

300
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,417
that brings everything
we've worked for,

301
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,375
everything we've
wanted crashing down.

302
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,292
Rough night's
sleep, Mr. Oldcross?

303
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,417
It's a big day.

304
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:12,917
May I come in.

305
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:15,292
Please.

306
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:21,750
To your right.

307
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,417
What can I help you
with then, officer?

308
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,625
Well, Mr. Oldcross,

309
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:42,542
I'm here in relation to an
incident

310
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,917
that occurred last night

311
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:45,851
that we have reason to believe

312
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,315
you may have had
some involvement in.

313
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:53,000
Would you like tea,
officer, hot coffee, maybe?

314
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,000
This is incredibly
serious. Mr. Oldcross.

315
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:04,375
It would be best if you
cooperated with my inquiries.

316
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,292
Look, I'm not sure where
you got this information from,

317
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,042
but I have a clue what
you are talking about.

318
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:19,542
All right, now I've got
an incredibly busy day

319
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:26,583
and I'd appreciate if you didn't
waste any more of my time.

320
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:35,458
Mr. Oldcross, I'm going to
make this very clear to you.

321
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,500
I'm here because we can
place you at the scene

322
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,708
of a double murder that
took place last night.

323
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,000
Now I'll say it
for a final time,

324
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,583
I strongly suggest
you cooperate.

325
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Okay.

326
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,458
Where do we go from here?

327
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,333
I'll need you to come
with me, Mr. Oldcross.

328
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,208
Shall we, Mr. Oldcross?

329
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,667
This isn't right, Bertie.

330
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,625
This is all gonna
end badly, Bertie.

331
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,417
There's a man lying
dead on your sofa.

332
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,292
What's wrong with you?

333
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,125
Mr. Oldcross,

334
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,958
did you kill
these two men last night?

335
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:02,333
No, no, please, I can explain.

336
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,750
That's him, all right.

337
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,042
Socialist scum.

338
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,833
Please, please, please.

339
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,917
It's for the best, Bertie.

340
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,083
No, please.

341
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:27,667
For the good of the
people, right, Bertie?

342
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,875
Rough night sleep. Mr. Oldcross?

343
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:54,500
It's a big day.

344
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
May I come in?

345
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,500
Please.

346
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,750
To the right.

347
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,125
I'm Officer Carrie.

348
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,125
Would you like to take a seat?

349
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,083
Of course, sorry.

350
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,375
Did you cut yourself?

351
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:39,042
Oh, I get nose bleeds, you know,

352
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,208
I do apologize.

353
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,792
Right, that's unfortunate.

354
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:50,708
Sorry, it's been
a long few weeks.

355
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,292
What can I do for you?

356
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,250
Mr. Oldcross.

357
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,500
Please, Bertie is fine.

358
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,458
I'm your chaperone for the day?

359
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,292
Chaperone?

360
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,917
Mr. Oldcross, Bertie,

361
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,059
I'll be chaperoning you
to cast your vote.

362
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,167
And later tonight I'll
take you to the count.

363
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,125
I thought you were informed.

364
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,167
Yes, yes, it must've
slipped my mind.

365
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:21,500
I'll need to change
before we head off.

366
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,833
Great, no problem at all.

367
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:29,000
I was told your
campaign manager, Simon,

368
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,292
who will be joining us

369
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,625
Is he on his way here or?

370
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,833
He's having the day for himself.

371
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:40,875
Makes sense.

372
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes.

373
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:49,167
So give me half an hour to
change and we can head out.

374
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,292
Great.

375
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:05,792
You okay, Simon?

376
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,833
Oh, fine, just got
a lot in my mind.

377
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,208
One too many drinks with Bertie?

378
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,417
Well, you must have
gotten late last night.

379
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,167
Must have been asleep by
the time you got home.

380
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,125
How did everything...

381
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,000
So what's on the agenda today?

382
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,167
Nothing.

383
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,375
Just myself.

384
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,583
Well, you definitely
deserve a rest.

385
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,042
Simon?

386
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,417
Sorry, sorry.

387
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,458
What is it then?

388
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,500
Did something happen
with Bertie last night?

389
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,750
What, no, no,
nothing's happened.

390
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,583
Well, what is it then.

391
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:17,292
Bertie's offered me a place
with his staff in London.

392
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,417
Which was always
the plan, right?

393
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,680
Well, I thought that'd
be an easy decision.

394
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,375
It is, it is.

395
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:29,750
If it goes his way, Bertie
offered a ministerial position

396
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,167
in prisons.

397
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,208
I thought you'd be
excited about that, though.

398
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,083
Big role.

399
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,583
It's just more than I expected.

400
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,375
Just gotta get my
head around things.

401
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:47,250
Right, well, whatever
happens, you know,

402
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,292
we are proud of you
and what you're doing.

403
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,458
Okay.

404
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,083
You're done?

405
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,167
Yeah.

406
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,625
Come on, let's go and
get those teeth brushed,

407
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,167
ready for school then.

408
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,083
Bertie, Bertie, Bertie.

409
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,875
Is this a done
deal for Labour, Bertie?

410
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:16,833
Have you done enough

411
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,934
to swing this
seat, Mr. Oldcross?

412
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,809
Bertie, how will you
shore up with your campaign?

413
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,958
How are you feeling
about tonight, Bertie?

414
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,292
How'd you sleep
last night, Mr. Oldcross.

415
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,125
I slept very well, thank you.

416
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:31,750
It's been a long campaign
and I'm glad it's over.

417
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,125
The people of
Scarborough and Whitby

418
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,667
as well as across the
country can finally go

419
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,417
to the polls to
make their choice.

420
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,583
Thank you very much.

421
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,500
Do you have any comments

422
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,333
on missing local
man, Adam Roberts?

423
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,333
I'm sorry?

424
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,500
Adam Roberts, reported
missing by his wife

425
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,143
last night after
failing to return home.

426
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,458
I wasn't aware of that.

427
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,508
The appeal's just gone
out to the local press.

428
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,583
Do you have anything
to say to his family?

429
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:00,792
Well, as I said, I,
I wasn't aware of it,

430
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,583
but my thoughts of course,
with his wife and family,

431
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,875
and I hope to hear of his
safe return home soon.

432
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,167
Morning Bertie, let's
get you checked in,

433
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,500
then you can cast your vote.

434
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,792
You've just missed
the pre-work rush,

435
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,167
so it's nice and quiet for you.

436
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,333
Has Simon been here?

437
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,042
Turnout looks
pretty good so far.

438
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,208
Obviously we're expecting a bit

439
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,500
of a flurry around lunchtime.

440
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,875
Mrs. Robinson,
has Simon been in?

441
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,125
Then of course after work,
there'll be another rush.

442
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,042
So really, you've
timed it perfectly to

443
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,875
Mrs. Robinson, Mrs.
Robinson, please,

444
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,917
have you seen
Simon this morning?

445
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:51,542
No, he hasn't been in yet.

446
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,375
Let's get you sorted.

447
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,583
Bertie Oldcross.

448
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,292
ID, please.

449
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,708
Use the booths at the
back, one cross only.

450
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,250
I killed Adam Roberts.

451
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,833
I killed Adam Roberts.

452
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,625
I killed Adam Roberts.

453
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,792
I killed Adam Roberts...

454
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
All done?

455
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,833
I won't ask who he voted for.

456
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,542
Over
here, Mr. Oldcross.

457
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,875
Thanks Mr. Oldcross.

458
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:38,458
Bertie, Bertie

459
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,625
Mr. Oldcross is back
in the vehicle, over.

460
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,833
There's a person
reported missing.

461
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,208
Adam Roberts.

462
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:06,792
Local press asked if
I had any information.

463
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,292
They've been asked
to put out an appeal.

464
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:14,250
Right, well, I've got to
go and speak to his family,

465
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:16,542
get some details.

466
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,875
Right.

467
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,917
So I'll drop you home now,

468
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,460
but I'll be back later to
escort you to the count.

469
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,417
Right, okay.

470
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,375
Okay then.

471
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:36,417
Come on, Simon, come
on, pick up, please.

472
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,958
Hello, your call cannot be taken

473
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:49,708
at the moment, so please leave
your message after the tone.

474
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,625
Around the country

475
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,542
are reporting
incredibly high turnouts

476
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,292
in this landmark
general election.

477
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:27,250
Schools, churches, and community
halls opened their doors

478
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,667
at 7:00 AM this morning
to welcome voters,

479
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,792
determined to have
their say on which party

480
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,750
is most fit to run the country.

481
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:34,875
Oh, you're in here.

482
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:37,667
Sit down there with
daddy while I'll go

483
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,870
and get your swimming stuff.

484
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,083
Open their
doors at 7:00 AM this morning

485
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,167
All okay?

486
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,000
Just keeping an eye on things.

487
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,208
Picture of the
Scarborough Gazette.

488
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,458
Bertie is on the front page.

489
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,542
Among the voters were

490
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:51,792
the candidates themselves,

491
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,851
each visiting their local
constituency polling station

492
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:54,875
to put the next

493
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:55,917
Adam Roberts.

494
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:59,083
I know, awful story.

495
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,375
He just disappeared
last night, apparently.

496
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,917
Alice, sweetie, why
don't you show daddy

497
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,708
that picture he made today

498
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:10,833
while I'll go sort your
bag, I'll be two minutes.

499
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:13,559
Did you make this at school?

500
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:14,583
Yep.

501
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:15,917
What's this

502
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:20,083
That's me, that's
mummy, and that's when you

503
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,458
win your competition.

504
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:23,917
Win my competition?

505
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,667
Yep, for today.

506
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,625
That's definitely one
for the fridge, aint it?

507
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:30,708
Definitely.

508
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,292
I don't think she knew
what was happening really,

509
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,417
but obviously she's picked
up more than we thought.

510
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,792
So what time do you think
the count will come in?

511
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,208
Just, I thought maybe we could

512
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,583
all go as a family, or
share the moment, you know.

513
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,042
Probably not till
the small hours.

514
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:54,250
I know, but I'd like
to be there for you then.

515
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,708
And Alice, obviously have
some idea what's going on.

516
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,667
Be nice for us to go
as a family together.

517
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,458
Right, let's get
you to swimming.

518
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,833
Go on, give daddy a hug.

519
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,958
See you later.

520
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,458
On the 1st of July.

521
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,792
They will also face economic
challenges domestically,

522
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,333
a topic which has
led the campaign

523
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,333
of both major parties
throughout the election,

524
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:23,792
as they seek support in
new parts of the country

525
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:24,792
for the next millennium,

526
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,167
as well as continuing work

527
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,125
in the Northern
Ireland peace process

528
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,448
as the country moves on from...

529
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:23,708
To start, I'd like to
thank you for choosing

530
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,750
to put your trust in me.

531
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:34,875
Dishonesty and selfishness have
become an unfortunate trait

532
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,042
of our politics over
the last few years.

533
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:44,083
The time has come for change,

534
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:51,125
and I am both
honored and excited

535
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,625
to be given the
chance to deliver it.

536
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:18,125
I chose to become a politician
because of my sister, Janet.

537
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:25,833
Janet was a police
officer, kind and caring.

538
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,875
She wasn't just trying
to enforce the law.

539
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:34,708
She saw her job as
trying to help the people

540
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:38,792
in her community in
any way she could.

541
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:44,875
Janet was my inspiration.

542
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,833
A year and a half,

543
00:54:54,625 --> 00:55:01,083
a year and a half ago,
she was killed on duty

544
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:06,750
by a man she was arresting
for stealing a purse.

545
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,833
It contained 30 pounds.

546
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:17,417
30 pounds.

547
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:44,667
Losing my sister broke my heart.

548
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:52,042
She was my world, my rock,

549
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,542
and that man took her
life over 30 pounds.

550
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:02,167
And why?

551
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:05,917
Because he was desperate.

552
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:11,167
Desperate to put
food on the table,

553
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:16,333
desperate to provide
for his family,

554
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:22,750
desperate to
survive in a society

555
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:26,542
that had abandoned
him beyond hope,

556
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:33,375
and it's for that reason,
I had to...

557
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:39,292
forgive him.

558
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,167
That's why I became
a politician.

559
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,917
I knew I had to find a way

560
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:09,875
to stop this happening again

561
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:14,583
to another person,

562
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:18,875
another family.

563
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,125
Hello, your call cannot

564
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,792
be taken at the moment, so
please leave your message

565
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:10,875
after the tone.

566
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:17,500
Simon, I know I said
I'd let you take the day,

567
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:21,875
give you time and space
to make your own decision.

568
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,042
I want to make sure we both
make the right choice here.

569
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,708
We've got a chance to
really make a difference.

570
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,208
We started this
thing to help people.

571
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:42,417
We can still do that.

572
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:49,458
If we only get a year
at this, or a month,

573
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:55,208
a week even, to me,
it's worth doing.

574
00:58:56,333 --> 00:59:00,667
It's worth doing together.

575
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:03,333
Simon...

576
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:22,292
We have Bertie
Oldcross Labour's candidate

577
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,375
for Scarborough and
Whitby in the studio,

578
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,208
ahead of polling day tomorrow.

579
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,333
Thanks Jen.

580
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:29,083
No, please, thank you Bertie

581
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:31,167
for spending your
final campaign hours

582
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,708
chatting to us and taking
calls from listeners.

583
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:34,792
Not at all.

584
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:35,833
My pleasure.

585
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,083
So Tony Blair's new Labour,

586
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,458
I mean, it's all been
a bit crazy isn't it?

587
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,458
How do you fit into all this?

588
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:47,208
It's incredible, being at
the center of this whirlwind,

589
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,917
you can really feel
people's excitement.

590
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:51,875
The campaign's
been a lot of fun.

591
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,458
Oh, well, I mean,
let's be honest,

592
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:55,208
the election's in
the bag, surely.

593
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,708
It's looking promising, but
until the votes are counted,

594
00:59:58,792 --> 00:59:59,833
anything can happen.

595
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,958
And what about the people
of our wonderful seaside town?

596
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:07,208
The people of Scarborough
and Whitby have been amazing,

597
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:10,292
really receptive of our message.

598
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,958
They want change.

599
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,167
That's been made
very, very clear.

600
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:17,792
And I am the man who
can bring that about.

601
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,351
Right, oh, I'm getting
the word from our producer

602
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,476
that we're ready to
take a few calls.

603
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,750
So should we crack on?

604
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,667
Please.

605
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,958
Okay, on the line is Caroline,

606
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:28,708
a dinner lady from Whitby High?

607
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,875
All right, Caroline.

608
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:30,958
Hello.

609
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:34,250
What's your question
for Bertie, Caroline?

610
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:35,583
Hi, Bertie.

611
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:36,667
Afternoon, Caroline.

612
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,250
First of
all, I'd just like to say

613
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,833
how fantastic it is
to see a local face

614
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:44,333
on all these posters,
such a handsome face too.

615
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:47,292
Thank you so much, Caroline.

616
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,083
Did you have a
question, Caroline?

617
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,625
Oh, yes, well,
I've lived in Scarborough

618
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,708
all my life.

619
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,833
It's always been a
peaceful friendly place,

620
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:58,042
but for the first time
in my life, really,

621
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,667
I don't feel very safe.

622
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:02,417
I'm sorry to hear
that, Caroline.

623
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,833
You know what, listen Bertie,

624
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,417
I do love you, Bertie,
but my granddaughters

625
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,667
walk to school each
morning, scared.

626
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,458
It's an absolute disgrace.

627
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,667
You're right, Caroline,
it is a disgrace.

628
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,917
No one should ever feel
unsafe on our streets,

629
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,333
and I hate to hear that
your granddaughters do.

630
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:25,333
I promise that a vote for me
tomorrow means we can start

631
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:29,042
putting more officers on the
ground with better training.

632
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:34,042
Our children should feel
safe walking to school.

633
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:39,875
You know, this is a
problem we're seeing right

634
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:43,667
across the country which
unfortunately is a direct result

635
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,500
of poor social policy by
the conservative government.

636
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,958
To me, everyone is important.

637
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,625
I'll ensure that our
offices truly understand

638
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,792
the local people and
the problems they face.

639
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:02,500
Now, if we can implement
that across the country,

640
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,833
we will be building a community
that is far better equipped

641
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:08,583
to serve everyone.

642
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,583
Anything to add, Caroline?

643
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,917
You've definitely
got my vote, Bertie,

644
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,125
and if you do win tomorrow,

645
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,917
I'll go for a swim in the
fountain in my knickers.

646
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,208
Right, thanks there, Caroline.

647
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,250
Moving on,

648
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,125
how do you in intend to pay
for all this Bertie?

649
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:29,750
I mean, this is pie in
the sky thinking, no?

650
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:34,000
Jen, everything's laid
out in our manifesto.

651
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,208
Under a Labour government,

652
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:40,083
no individual will be
overlooked or forgotten.

653
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,250
We won't try to sweep our
problems under the carpet.

654
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:46,583
That's how I intend to
tackle the rising crime

655
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:51,208
and how the Labour party
will offer true prosperity

656
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,667
to all the people
of Great Britain.

657
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,625
That was a grand plan, Bertie.

658
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:59,833
Things can only get better.

659
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,958
Wow, our switchboard
is really lighting up.

660
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,792
So you ready for another caller?

661
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:08,750
We have Lenny from Barrow Cliff.

662
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,292
All right, Lenny,
what's your question?

663
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,458
Around the United Kingdom...

664
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,000
Numbers looking healthy
going into the polls tomorrow.

665
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,167
Our estimate puts
you at almost 20%.

666
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,292
Same story with the
party across the country,

667
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:25,375
We're over the line.

668
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,542
Thanks Simon, for everything.

669
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,250
We make a great team.

670
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:32,750
People love you.

671
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,684
I hope it goes without
saying there's certainly place

672
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:37,500
for you in my office
at Westminster.

673
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,833
From Scarborough to parliament.

674
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,917
Can't think of anyone
I'd rather do this with.

675
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:49,000
Well then, old man,
I'd better tell Sarah,

676
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,750
Darling, we are
moving to London.

677
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,333
I shouldn't be too long.

678
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:10,467
Soon as Alice is in bed,
I'll be back for you.

679
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,833
Please, family comes first.

680
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:15,333
These end of campaign
parties are just a booze up

681
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,667
for the volunteers anyway.

682
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:20,542
Oh, I don't think
it's too preemptive

683
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,000
to start familiarizing
yourself with this.

684
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,500
I'll be back around
nine, latest.

685
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:46,333
Across the country,

686
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:49,083
reports from our final
polls are flying in.

687
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:52,792
The Northeast is predicted to
swing heavily towards Labour

688
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:56,083
in tomorrow's voting with
Durham and Middlesbrough

689
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,208
deep in the red.

690
01:04:57,542 --> 01:05:00,917
The biggest shock is expected
in Scarborough and Whitby

691
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:04,792
where Labour are polling
at 20 plus points ahead.

692
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:07,875
It would seem Bertie
Oldcross can do no wrong

693
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:09,708
in the race for that seat.

694
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:14,083
Moving down south, we see a
similar picture in London.

695
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,583
We have Tony Blair's Labour
predicted to steal seats

696
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,167
across the capital in what
could be a landslide result

697
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,500
for his party.

698
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:35,042
To start, I'd like to
thank you for choosing

699
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:38,375
to put your trust in me.

700
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,042
Dishonesty and selfishness have
become an unfortunate trait

701
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,833
of our politics over
the last few years.

702
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,542
The time has come for change,

703
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,750
and I am both...

704
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,125
honored,

705
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:08,500
honored and excited to be
given the chance to deliver it.

706
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,208
Honored and excited.

707
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,125
Honored, and excited...

708
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:31,667
Sorry, I'm a tad late,
ready to rock and roll?

709
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,792
Nearly there.

710
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,167
If you say so.

711
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:40,917
Did you get a chance
to read it then?

712
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,583
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

713
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:47,667
And?

714
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,708
A winner as always.

715
01:06:54,667 --> 01:07:01,167
It's strange to think
tomorrow's result,

716
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,625
well, may only be the beginning.

717
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:05,667
At least tonight
we can celebrate

718
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,833
a campaign superbly run.

719
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,208
True.

720
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,073
Even if you do say so yourself.

721
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,125
Shall we?

722
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,750
Mind if I drive.

723
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:29,292
Fine by me.

724
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,250
Let's hear it then.

725
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:40,833
What's that?

726
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,208
The speech obviously.

727
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:45,792
Well, I'm not sure
I know it all that well yet.

728
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,250
Just bridge
the gaps with anything

729
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,375
that comes naturally.

730
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:52,458
To start, I'd like to
thank you for choosing

731
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:54,500
to put your trust in me.

732
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:58,458
Dishonesty and selfishness have
become an unfortunate trait

733
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,083
of our politics over
the last few years.

734
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,042
The time has come for
change and I am both

735
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,542
honored

736
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,000
and excited to...

737
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:38,917
Simon.

738
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,792
Look at me, Simon.

739
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:47,083
This is bad, Bertie.

740
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:50,667
We need to get help.

741
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,458
Hey, we need to call an
ambulance or the police.

742
01:09:53,542 --> 01:10:00,083
Simon breathe, take a
breath and listen to me.

743
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,833
We are not calling anyone.

744
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,083
Listen to what I'm saying.

745
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:10,500
We're going to get
this man off the road

746
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:13,375
and back to my house
where we can make

747
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:17,792
a proper rational decision
about what we're going to do.

748
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,083
Yes?

749
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,500
No, Bertie, please,
we need to call someone.

750
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:28,625
Simon, I'm telling you,
we are not calling anyone.

751
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,500
This isn't right, Bertie.

752
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,917
As clocks across the
United Kingdom strike 10

753
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:39,042
and polls closed for the
1997 general election,

754
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,750
we can give you the
results of our exit poll

755
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:43,458
from voters around the country.

756
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:47,042
There it is, 10 o'clock,
voting is now closed

757
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:50,167
and our exit poll is
predicting a landslide victory

758
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,208
for Tony Blair and
the Labour Party.

759
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:55,542
Stay with us through the night
as we bring you live results

760
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:58,792
from constituencies
around the United Kingdom

761
01:11:58,875 --> 01:11:59,875
as counts are confirmed.

762
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,708
Not looking too bad for
you guys as it stands.

763
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,042
Sorry.

764
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:18,000
The count, it's going
well for your party.

765
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,292
Looks like it could
be a big moment.

766
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:24,625
Definitely, very exciting times.

767
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:31,417
So was there any news
about that missing man?

768
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,042
Did his wife say
anything helpful?

769
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:37,292
I know it sounds
hard, considering,

770
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,958
but I can't actually
say anything to you

771
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,417
Although after tonight, that
may be a different story.

772
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,625
Any sign of Simon.

773
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,208
He didn't come with you?

774
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,351
I left a message
for him when I heard

775
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,083
the result was closed.

776
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,083
I can try again.

777
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:36,583
No, I'm sure he'll
be here in a minute.

778
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:42,333
Oh, I'd like to give
a quick thanks to all

779
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:44,708
of our volunteers for
your speedy work over

780
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:46,208
the past few hours.

781
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,208
Now we are preparing to deliver,

782
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,083
so if I could get all
candidates to the stage

783
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:55,833
so we can proceed, please.

784
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,250
Thank you.

785
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,250
Righty-ho, all here.

786
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,792
Good stuff, good stuff.

787
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:17,458
So in a moment I'd
like you all to step

788
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:20,250
onto the stage and line
yourselves up at the back,

789
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:23,750
at which point I will proceed
to announce the vote count

790
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:26,667
for each candidate and finish
by confirming the winner.

791
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,917
All clear so far?

792
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,500
Perfect.

793
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:33,750
Now we have been notified

and the winning candidate
will be invited obviously

796
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:41,833
to say a few words
at the microphone

797
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:45,250
once the formalities of the
declaration have been fulfilled.

798
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,833
All clear?

799
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:50,833
Okay, if you'd like to
step onto the stage,

800
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,000
we are ready to declare.

801
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:54,667
Good luck to you all.

802
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:10,917
As Scarborough and
Whitby returning officer,

803
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:14,083
it is my duty to return
the result for the election

804
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:20,000
held on May 1st, 1997, for
this parliamentary seat.

votes cast were 54,321.

807

812
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:06,417
To start, I'd like to
thank you for choosing

813
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,417
to put your trust in me.

814
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:19,292
Dishonesty and selfishness have
become an unfortunate trait

815
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:22,917
of our politics over
the last few years.

816
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:29,667
The time has come for change.

817
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:38,333
And for this reason I must

818
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,750
make a confession.

818
01:18:44,305 --> 01:19:44,542
